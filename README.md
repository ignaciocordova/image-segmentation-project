# image-segmentation-project
This project is part of my undergrad course "Image Processing and Artificial Vision". It consists on analyzing the state of the art algorithms for solving segmentation of microscopic imagery. My study selects problematic images that cause problems to this algorithms and offers specific solutions that improve results. 

Through this project I have learned how to plan and execute a project end to end. I have also learned to extract and organize the most important aspects and results to write a paper in a strict scientific style. I feel prepared to engage in more complex and longer projects that will bring value to the scientific community. 

You can find all the code in the following modules and notebooks: 

1. First Image DIC_SN_15_L10_Sum00.ipynb
2. Second Image DIC_SN_15_L7_Sum00.ipynb
3. Third Image DIC_SN_15_L38_Sum16.ipynb

And the final paper at: Final_Project_Paper.pdf
