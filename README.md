# image-segmentation-project
This project is part of my undergrad course "Image Processing and Artificial Vision". It consists on analyzing the state of the art algorithms for solving segmentation of microscopic imagery. My study selects problematic images that cause problems to this algorithms and offers specific solutions that improve results.
