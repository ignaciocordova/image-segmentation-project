# image-segmentation-project
This project is part of my undergrad course "Image Processing and Artificial Vision". It consists on analyzing the state of the art algorithms for solving segmentation of microscopic imagery. My study selects problematic images that cause problems to this algorithms and offers specific solutions that improve results. 

This project has allowed me to learn how to plan and execute a project end to end. I have also learned to extract and organize the most important aspects and results to write a paper in a strict scientific style. I feel prepared to engage in more complex and loger projects that will bring value to the scientific community.
