Image Segmentation techniques ( 1/3 )

The first image I will work with is the easiest one for segmentation. This part
 of the study will provide a general idea of how segmentation can be performed
 and will serve as introduction to better understand the next, more problematic
 images. As you can see in the image below, **segmentation can not be performed 
 based on color (or gray-scale value)** so I will have to find other properties 
 that vary between regions.

"""
High pass filter aproach
 
 The idea behind this kind of segmentation relies on the structure difference 
 between the central cut and the tissue. I will exploit the texture properties 
 of the membrane to differentiate it from the wound.
 
 One possible approach is to try to retain the parts of the image with high 
 detail. In other words, gather in formation aboout change of contrast, edges,
 shapes, etc. This can be achieved by applying a "high pass filter" to the 
 Fourier Transform of the image. This means dropping the low frequencies in the
 Fourier space and keeping just the frequencies in charge of these properties
 (change of contrast, edges, shapes, etc).

The next function I built (can be found in the "impavi" module) performs
 K-means to the image using k=7 in this case. This allows to have a better,
 more refined segmentation than just a binarization. I built he function 
 "apply_kmeans" so that it automatically returns the largest cluster out 
 of the k clusters.

 biological images*" will give a very useful result to later apply the median
